#===============================================================
#http://r-exercises.com/2017/01/12/lets-get-started-with-dplyr/
#Let’s get started with dplyr
#===============================================================

#Install and load the package dplyr package
library(dplyr)
df=data.frame(Theoph)

#Use the names() function to get the column names of df.
names(df)

#Let’s practice using the select() function. This allows you to work with just column names instead of indices.
#a) Select only the columns starting from Subject to Dose
#b) Only select the Wt and Dose columns now.
select(df, Subject:Dose)
select(df,Subject,Wt)

#Let’s look at the sample with Dose greater than 5 mg/kg. Use the filter command() to return df with Dose>5′
filter(df, Dose>5)

#Great. Now use filter command to return df with Dose>5 and Time greater than the mean Time.
filter(df, Dose>5 & Time>mean(Time))

#Now let’s try sorting the data. Use the arrange() function to
#1) arrange df by weight (descending)
#2) arrange df by weight (ascending)
#3) arrange df by weight (ascending) and Time (descending)
arrange(df, desc(Wt))
arrange(df, Wt)
arrange(df, Wt, desc(Time))

#The mutate() command allows you to create a new column using conditions and data derived from other columns. Use mutate() command to create a new column called trend that equals to Time-mean(Time). This will tell you how far each time value is from its mean. Set na.rm=TRUE.
mutate(df, trend = Time-mean(Time, na.rm = T))

#Given the meta-data
#76.2 kg Super-middleweight
#72.57 kg Middleweight
#69.85 kg Light-middleweight
#66.68 kg Welterweight
#Use the mutate function to classify the weight using the information above. For the purpose of this exercise, considering anything above 76.2 kg to be Super-middleweight and anything below 66.8 to be Welterweight. Anything below 76.2 to be middleweight and anything below 72.57 to be light-middleweight. Store the classifications under weight_cat. Hint: Use ifelse function() with mutate() to achieve this. Store this back into df.
mutate(df, weight_cat = ifelse(Wt < 69.85, "Welterweight", ifelse(Wt < 72.57, "Light-middleweight", ifelse(Wt < 76.2, "middleweight", ifelse(Wt > 76.2, "Super-Middleweight", "Unknown")))))

#Use the groupby() command to group df by weight_cat. This allows us to use aggregated functions similar to group by in SQL. Store this in a df called weight_group
weight_group=group_by(df, weight_cat)

#Use the summarize() command on the weight_group created in Question 9 to find the mean Time and sum of Dose received by each weight categories.
summarize(df,Avg_Time=mean(Time),Total_Dose=sum(Dose))
