library(forecast)
library(tseries)

df <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\user\\Documents\\GitHub\\Exercises-1\\sales.csv")

# Transform the data into a time series object of the ts type (indicate that the data is monthly, and the starting period is January 1992). Print the data.
series <- ts(df, frequency = 12, start = c(1992,1))
print(series)


# Plot the time series. Ensure that the y axis starts from zero.
plot(series, ylim=c(0,40000))


# Use the gghistogram function from the forecast package to visually inspect the distribution of time series values. Add a kernel density estimate and a normal density function to the plot.
require(forecast)
gghistogram(series, add.normal = TRUE, add.kde = TRUE)


# Use the decompose function to break the series into seasonal, trend, and irregular components (apply multiplicative decomposition). Plot the decomposed series.
series_decomposed <- decompose(series, type = "multiplicative")
plot(series_decomposed)


# Explore the structure of the decomposed object, and find seasonal coefficients (multiples). Identify the three months with the greatest coefficients, and the three months with the smallest coefficients. (Note that the coefficients are equal in different years).
seasonal_coef <- data.frame(series_decomposed$figure)
seasonal_coef <- cbind(seasonal_coef, seq(1:12))
seasonal_coef[order(-seasonal_coef [,1]),]
# months with the greatest seasonal coefficients are December (1.693),
# November (1.097), and August (1.032)
# months with the smallest  seasonal coefficients are January (0.733),
# February (0.823), and September (0.913)


# Check whether the time series is trend-stationary (i.e. its mean and variance are constant with respect to a trend) using the function kpss.test from the tseries package. (Note that the null hypothesis of the test is that the series is trend-stationary).
require(tseries)
kpss.test(series)
# p-value < 0.01, so the null hypothesis can be rejected at conventional 
# confidence levels, which implies that the series is not trend-stationary.


# Use the diff function to create a differenced time series (i.e. a series that includes differences between the values of the original series), and test it for trend stationarity.
require(tseries)
series_differenced <- diff(series)
kpss.test(series_differenced)
# p-value > 0.10, so the null hypothesis cannot be rejected at conventional 
# confidence levels, therefore the series can be deemed trend-stationary.


# Plot the differenced time series.
plot(series_differenced)


# Use the Acf and Pacf functions from the forecast package to explore autocorrelation of the differenced series. Find at which lags correlation between lagged values is statistically significant at 5% level.
require(forecast)
Acf(series_differenced)
Pacf(series_differenced)
# the coefficients located beyond the area enclosed by the two blue dotted lines
# are statistically significant at 5% level (the default significance level
# for the Acf and Pacf functions)
