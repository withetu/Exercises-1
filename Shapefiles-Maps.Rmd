#Working with Shapefiles in R Exercises
#==========================================================================

#A shapefile is a simple, nontopological format for storing the geometric location and attribute information of geographic features. Geographic features in a shapefile can be represented by points, lines, or polygons (ESRI). The geographic features are associated with an attribute table which is very similar to an R dataframe.

#Read the London Sports map from the shapefile london_sports.shp
london <- readOGR(dsn = ".", layer = "london_sport")

#Change the coordinate system of the map to WGS 84
london <- spTransform(london, CRS("+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84"))

#Find the names of the zones where sports participation rates is more than 25%.
london[which(london@data$Partic_Per>25),]@data$name

#Plot the london map in Sky Blue, along with a title.
plot(london, col="skyblue")
title("Map of London")

#Plot the zones in London with Sports Participation Rates less than 15% in red. Retain the earlier blue color for other zones.
plot(london[which(london@data$Partic_Per<15),], col="red", add=T)

#Plot the zones in London with Sports Participation Rates more than 25% in green. Retain the earlier color for other zones.
plot(london[which(london@data$Partic_Per>25),], col="green", add=T)

#Place a black circle marker at the centre of each zone. Retain previous maps.
midpoints <- coordinates(london)
points(midpoints, col = "black", pch = 20)

#Put labels for each zone. Place the labels to the right of the black marker.
text(coordinates(london), as.character(london@data$name), pos = 4, cex = 0.5)

#Add another categorical attribute sports_part which has values "low", "medium" and "high" for sports participation rates less than equal to 15%, between 15 to 25% and greater than 25% respectively.
london@data$sports_part[which(london@data$Partic_Per<=15)]<-"low"
london@data$sports_part[which(london@data$Partic_Per>15 & london@data$Partic_Per<=25)]<-"medium"
london@data$sports_part[which(london@data$Partic_Per>25)]<-"high"

#Save the new map object with modified attribute table as a new shapefile “london_sport2.shp”.
writeOGR(london, ".", "london_sport2", driver="ESRI Shapefile")
