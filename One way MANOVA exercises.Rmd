# One way MANOVA exercises

# ================================================================




# Import data into R

# Read in SPSS data
library(foreign)
koro.data = read.spss("C:\\Users\\user\\Documents\\GitHub\\Exercises-1\\koro.sav",to.data.frame = TRUE)
View(koro.data)
attach(koro.data)

# Check the number of observations in each group
table(therapy)

# Create the variables that hold the change in indices
koro.data$si.diff = si_post - si_pre
koro.data$sf.diff = sf_post - sf_pre
koro.data$oa.diff = oa_post - oa_pre

# Summarize the change variables
library(pastecs)
indices = koro.data[,c(3,10,11,12)]
stat.desc(indices)

# Get descriptive statistics for each therapy
library(psych)
describeBy(indices[-1], therapy)

# Obtain the correlation matrix
library(Hmisc)
rcorr(as.matrix(indices[-1]),type = "pearson")
#Our variables are moderately correlated. When variables are highly correlated some need to be dropped

# Check for univariate and multivariate outliers
library(ggplot2)
#Check univariate outliers
ggplot(indices, aes(x=therapy, y=si.diff)) + geom_boxplot()
ggplot(indices, aes(x=therapy, y=oa.diff)) + geom_boxplot()
ggplot(indices, aes(x=therapy, y=sf.diff)) + geom_boxplot()
#Box plots show some observations are outliers
#Check multivariate outliers
library(mvoutlier)
aq.plot(indices[-1])
## Projection to the first and second robust principal components.
## Proportion of total variation (explained variance): 0.7961158

# Check for  homogeneity of variance
bartlett.test(sf.diff~therapy, data = indices)
bartlett.test(si.diff~therapy, data = indices)
bartlett.test(oa.diff~therapy, data = indices)
#There was no evidence of departure from homogeneity of variance

# Run MANOVA with outliers
manova.analysis = manova(as.matrix(indices[-1])~therapy)
summary(manova.analysis)
summary(manova.analysis, test = "Wilks")
#Both Pillai and Wilk's lambda showed significance

# Interpret results

#We did not find violation of any of assumptions required for MANOVA analysis
#However we identified some observations that were outliers
#In part 2 of MANOVA exercises we will drop the outliers and repeat the analysis
#In part 2 we will explain what to do when we have a significant result
