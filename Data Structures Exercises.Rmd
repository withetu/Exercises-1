# Create a vector named v which contains 10 random integer values between -100 and +100.
v <- sample(-100:100, 10, replace = TRUE)


# Create a two-dimensional 5×5 array named a comprised of sequence of even integers greater than 25.
a <- array(seq(from = 26, length.out = 25, by = 2), c(5,5)) 
# Create a list named s containing sequence of 20 capital letters, starting with ‘C’.
s <- LETTERS[match("C", LETTERS):(match("C", LETTERS)+19)]


# Create a list named l and put all previously created objects in it. Name them a, b and c respectively. How many elements are there in the list? Show the structure of the list. Count all elements recursively.
l <- list(a = v, b = a, c = s)
length(l)

str(l)

length(unlist(l))


# Without running commands in R, answer the following questions:
#what is the result of l[[3]]?
#How would you access random-th letter in the list element c?
#If you convert list l to a vector, what will be the type of it’s elements?
#Can this list be converted to an array? What will be the data type of elements in array?
l[[3]]
l[[3]][sample(1:length(l[[3]]),1)]
class(unlist(l))
x <- array(l)
class(x[1])


# Remove letters from the list l. Convert the list l to a vector and check its class. Compare it with the result from exercise 4, question #3.
l$c <- NULL
class(unlist(l))


# Find the difference between elements in l[["a"]] and l[["b"]]. Find the intersection between them. Is there number 33 in their union?
setdiff(l$a, l$b)

intersect(l$a, l$b)

33 %in% union(l$a, l$b)


# Create 5×5 matrix named m and fill it with random numeric values rounded to two decimal places, ranging from 1.00 to 100.00.
m <- matrix(data = round(runif(5*5, 0.99, 100.00), 2), nrow = 5)


# What will be the class of data structure if you convert matrix m to:
#vector
#list
#data frame
#array?
class(as.vector(m))
class(as.list(m))
class(as.data.frame(m))
class(as.array(m))


# Transpose array l$b and then convert it to matrix.
as.matrix(aperm(l$b))


# Get union of matrix m and all elements in list l and sort it ascending.
sort(union(as.vector(m), unlist(l)))
