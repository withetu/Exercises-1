# Use the data function to load the treering dataset from the R library. This dataset is loaded as an R time series object which is a vector whose value are ordered chronologically. Look at the structure of this ts object and use another function to find the number of observations in the dataset.
data("treering")
str(treering)
length(treering)


# Use the function window(ts, start, end) to select the observations in the treering dataset from the year 1500 to the year 2000.
ts1 <- window(treering, start = 1500, end = 2000)


# Do a basic plot of the treering dataset and use the abline function to add an horizontal red line representing the mean of the dataset.
plot(ts1)
abline(a=mean(ts1), b=0, col = "red")


# Load the forecast package and use the Acf function to draw the autocorrelation plot of the time series.
library
Acf(ts1)


# Use the Box.test function to apply the Box-Ljung test on the data set. Set the parameter lag to the maximum value of Lag in the previous plot.
Box.test(ts1, lag = 27, type = "Ljung-Box")


# Load the tseries package and apply the Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin test by using the kpss.test function on the data.
library(tseries)
kpss.test(ts1, null = "Level")


# Use the adf.test function to apply the Augmented Dickey–Fuller t-statistic test on the dataset. Set the argument alternative to “stationary”.
adf.test(ts1, k=21, alternative="stationary")


# Use the Holt-Winters Filtering method to apply an exponential smoothing on the time series. Use the function HoltWinters with the parameters beta and gamma set to “FALSE” to select the exponential smoothing and start the function at the first observation of the dataset. Store the result in a variable named HW.
HW <- HoltWinters(ts1, beta = FALSE, gamma = FALSE, l.start = ts1[1])


# With the forecast.HoltWinters function make predictions for the next 5 years, store the results in a variable named prediction and print it to the screen.
prediction <- forecast.HoltWinters(HW, h=5)
prediction


# Use the plot.forecast function from the forecast package to plot your predictions.
plot.forecast(prediction)
