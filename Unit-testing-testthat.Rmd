# Unit testing in R using testthat library Exercises

# ===============================================================================





#Install and load the package testthat using the appropriate function.
library(testthat)

#expect_that() is the function that makes the binary assertion of whether or not the value is as expected.
#expect_that(x,equals(y)) reads as “it is expected that ‘a’ will be equal to ‘b'”.
#Use this function to see if 5*2 equals 10
expect_that(5*2, equals(10))

#The function equals() checks for equality with a numerical tolerance. Let’s see what that tolerance level is
expect_that(5*2, equals(10+ 1e-7))
expect_that(5*2, equals(10+ 1e-6))

#To exactly match the values is_identical_to() can be used instead of equals()
#Using the appropriate function, check if 2*2 is identical to 4 + (1e-8)
expect_that(2*2, is_identical_to(4+ 1e-8))

#Let us create a function (m) to multiply two numbers ( two arguments ) and check if it throws an error with character input arguments.
#Check if m(“2″,”3”) throws an error “non-numeric argument to binary operator”
m <- function(x,y)
{
  return(x*y)
}

expect_that(m("2", "3"), throws_error("non-numeric argument to binary operator"))



#Now that we know how to check for expectations, let us create tests.
#Test is a collection of expectations, where these expectations test a single item of the functionality of a process.
#test_that() is the function that encapsulates the description and the code to test each expectation.
#The first argument is the description and the second argument is a collection of expectations.
#Create a test for function ‘m’ with description “Testing multiplication function” and add a few scenarios to it.
#1. Check if m(2,3) equals 6
#2. Check if m(2,c(2,3)) equals c(4,6)
#3. Check if m(2,”3″) throws an error “non-numeric argument to binary operator”
test_that("Testing multiplication function",
          {
            expect_that(m(2,3), equals(6))
            expect_that(m(2,c(2,3)), equals(c(4,6)))
            expect_that(m(2,"3"), throws_error("non-numeric argument to binary operator"))
          })



#The User can write his own expectation using the expect() function. This expectation should compare the input value and the expectation and report the result.
is_greater_10 <- function(){
  function(x){
    expect(x>10, "Not greater than 10")
  }
}


#Use the expectation defined above to check if 9 is greater than 10.
expect_that(9, is_greater_10())



#tests can be put together in a file and run at once. Write tests of your choice and save them in a file.
#Use the function test_file() to run all the tests in the file.
test_file(<Path to the file with test script>)


#Test files in a directory can be run at once using the function test_dir().
#Create multiple test files and save them in a directory. Run all the tests at once using the function.
test_dir(<Path to the directory with test files>)
