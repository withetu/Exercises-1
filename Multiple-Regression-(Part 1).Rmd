#Multiple Regression (Part 1)
#==============================================================


#a. Load the state datasets.
data(state)
#b. Convert the state.x77 dataset to a dataframe.
state77 = as.data.frame(state.x77)
#c. Rename the Life Exp variable to Life.Exp, and HS Grad to HS.Grad. (This avoids problems with referring to these variables when specifying a model.)
names(state77)[4] <- "Life.Exp"
names(state77)[6] <- "HS.Grad"

#Suppose we wanted to enter all the variables in a first-order linear regression model with Life Expectancy as the dependent variable. Fit this model.
model <- lm(Life.Exp ~ ., data = state77) #the '.' means 'all'
summary(model)

#Suppose we wanted to remove the Income, Illiteracy, and Area variables from the model in Exercise 2. Use the update function to fit this model.
model2 <- update(model, . ~ . -Income -Illiteracy -Area) #the '.' means 'same as in original model'
summary(model2)

#Letâ€™s assume that we have settled on a model that has HS.Grad and Murder as predictors. Fit this model.
model3 <- lm(Life.Exp ~ HS.Grad+Murder, data = state77)
summary(model3)

#Add an interaction term to the model in Exercise 4 (3 different ways).
model4 <- lm(Life.Exp ~ HS.Grad+Murder+HS.Grad:Murder, data = state77)
summary(model4)
model4 <- lm(Life.Exp ~ HS.Grad*Murder, data = state77)
summary(model4)
model4 <- lm(Life.Exp ~ (HS.Grad+Murder)^2, data = state77)
summary(model4)

#For this and the remaining exercises in this set we will use the model from Exercise 4.
#Obtain 95% confidence intervals for the coefficients of the two predictor variables.
confint(model3, level = 0.95)

#Predict the Life Expectancy for a state where 55% of the population are High School graduates, and the murder rate is 8 per 100,000.
predict(model3, data.frame(HS.Grad=55, Murder=8))

#Obtain a 98% confidence interval for the mean Life Expectancy in a state where 55% of the population are High School graduates, and the murder rate is 8 per 100,000.
predict(model3, data.frame(HS.Grad=55, Murder=8), interval = "confidence", level = 0.98)

#Obtain a 98% confidence interval for the Life Expectancy of a person living in a state where 55% of the population are High School graduates, and the murder rate is 8 per 100,000.
predict(model3,data.frame(HS.Grad=55,Murder=8),interval="prediction",level=0.98)

#Since our model only has two predictor variables, we can generate a 3D plot of our data and the fitted regression plane. Create this plot.
