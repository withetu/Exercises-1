#Multiple Regression (Part 2) – Diagnostics
#==========================================================================



#a. Load the state datasets.
data(state)
#b. Convert the state.x77 dataset to a dataframe.
state77 <- as.data.frame(state.x77)
#c. Rename the Life Exp variable to Life.Exp, and HS Grad to HS.Grad. (This avoids problems with referring to these variables when specifying a model.)
names(state77)[4] <- "Life.Exp"
names(state77)[6] <- "HS.Grad"
#d. Produce the correlation matrix.
round(cor(state77), 3) #displays correlations to 3 decimal places
#e. Create a scatterplot matrix for the variables Life.Exp, HS.Grad, Murder, and Frost.
pairs(~ Life.Exp + HS.Grad + Murder + Frost, data = state77, gap=0)


#a. Fit the model with Life.Exp as dependent variable, and HS.Grad and Murder as predictors.
model <- lm(Life.Exp ~ HS.Grad + Murder, data = state77)
summary(model)
#b. Obtain the residuals.
resids <- model$residuals
#c. Obtain the fitted values.
fitted <- model$fitted.values


#a. Create a residual plot (residuals vs. fitted values).
plot(fitted, resids, main = "Residual Plot", xlab = "Fitted Values", ylab = "Residuals")
abline(h = 0, col="red")
#b. Create the same residual plot using the plot command on the lm object from Exercise 2.
plot(model, which = 1)


#Create plots of the residuals vs. each of the predictor variables.
par(mfrow=c(1,2)) # draw the two plots side by side

plot(state77$HS.Grad, resids, main = "Residuals vs HS.Grad", xlab = "HS.Grad", ylab = "Residuals")
abline(h = 0, col = "red")
plot(state77$Murder, resids, main = "Residuals vs Murder", xlab = "Murder", ylab = "Residuals")
abline(h = 0, col = "red")

par(mfrow = c(1,1)) # restore to the default


#a. Create a Normality plot.
qqnorm(resids, ylab = "Residuals")
qqline(resids)
#b. Create the same plot using the plot command on the lm object from Exercise 2.
plot(model, which = 2)


#a. Obtain the studentized residuals.
stzed <- rstudent(model)
#b. Does there appear to be any outliers?
stzed[abs(stzed) >2]


#a. Obtain the leverage value for each observation and plot them.
lever <- hat(model.matrix(model))
plot(lever)
#b. Obtain the conventional threshold for leverage values. Are any observations influential?
  #obtain the threshold
thresh2 <- 2*length(model$coefficients)/length(lever)
  #print leverage values above threshold
lever[lever>thresh2]
  #print corresponding state names
rownames(state77)[which(lever>thresh2)]


#a. Obtain DFFITS values.
dffits1 <- dffits(model)
#b. Obtain the conventional threshold. Are any observations influential?
thresh3 <- 2*sqrt(length(model$coefficients)/length(dffits1))
dffits1[dffits1 > thresh3]
#c. Obtain DFBETAS values.
dfbetas1 <- dfbetas(model)
#d. Obtain the conventional threshold. Are any observations influential?
thresh4 <- 2/sqrt(length(dfbetas1[,1]))
dfbetas1[dfbetas1[,1] > thresh4,1] #for intercept

dfbetas1[dfbetas1[,2] > thresh4,2] #for HS.Grad

dfbetas1[dfbetas1[,3] > thresh4,3] #for Murder


#a. Obtain Cook’s distance values and plot them.
cooksd <- cooks.distance(model)
plot(cooksd, ylab = "Cook's Distance")
#b. Obtain the same plot using the plot command on the lm object from Exercise 2.
plot(model, which=4)
#c. Obtain the threshold value. Are any observations influential?
thresh <- 4/length(resids)
cooksd[cooksd > thresh]


#Create the Influence Plot using a function from the car package.
library(car)
influencePlot(model, main="Influence Plot")
