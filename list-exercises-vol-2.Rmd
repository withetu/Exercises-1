#Consider 3 vectors, day, month and year:
year=c(2005:2017)
month=c(1:12)
day=c(1:31)
#Define a list Date such as:
#Date=
#$year
 #[1] 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016
#$month
# [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12
#$day
# [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31
Date=list()  
Date$year=year
Date$month=month
Date$day=day
Date

#write an R statement that will replace the values of year element in Date list for c(2000:2010).
Date$year=c(2000:2010)
Date

#write an R statement that will delete the value 4 of the month component of the list Date.
Date$month=Date$month[-4]
Date

#Consider a vector x such that:
x=c(1,3,4,7,11,18,29)
#Write an R statement that will return a list X2 with components of value:
#x*2,x/2,sqrt(x) and names "x*2","x/2","sqrt(x)"
X2=list('x*2'=x*2, 'x/2'=x/2, 'sqrt(x)'=sqrt(x))
X2

#Consider the X2 list.
#Write an R statement that will return a vector:
#2.000000 2.645751 3.316625
X2[[3]][3:5]

#Write an R statement that will return a concatenation of Date and X2 lists.
M=c(Date, X2)
M

#Write an R statement that will return a sublist N of M, with components year,x*2 and day.
N=M[c('year','x*2','day')]
N

#Consider the N list.
#Write an R statement that will return:
#-the length of x*2 vector in N
#-the value of the second element of vector year in N
length(N[[2]])
N$year[2]

#Consider 3 letters vectors, and 2 numeric vectors:
A=letters[1:4];B=letters[5:10];C=letters[11:15]
D=c(1:10);E=c(20:5)
#Define a list z, with elementes x and y,such that
#x is a list  with elements A,B,and C.
#and y is alist with elements D and E.
x=list(A,B,C)
y=list(D,E)
z=list(x,y)
z

#Write an R statement that will return:
#-the number on third position on the second vector of the first list of z
#-the letter on fifth position on the third vector of the second list of z
